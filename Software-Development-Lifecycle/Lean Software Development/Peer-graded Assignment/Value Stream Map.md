Please calculate the Process Cycle Efficiency for this Value Stream? Please show your calculations.

Process Cycle Efficiency= valued process time / cycle time
Valued Added time= 10 +1 +1 +60 + 1 +30 +240 +30 +60 +30 +60 + 30 +4320 +1440 +10 =6323 min
Non valued Added time = 720 + 720 +720 + 720 + 4320 +1440 +2880 +1440 +4320 + 7200 +7200 +720 = 32400 min
Cycle time= 6323 + 32400 =38723 min
So, Process Cycle Efficiency= 6323 / 38723 = 0.163 =16.3%

Make a recommendation for improving this process. Please specify what impact it will have in terms of VSM step and process cycle efficiency. Please calcuate new Process cycle efficiency if recommendations are implemented (HINT: For recommendations, think about merging steps, removing un-necessary steps or recommending alternatives to improve some of the process)?

Merging:
Merging steps from 1 to 6 into one step wherestep no. 2 is removed (the approval step). The client can create an account and receive the confirmation email immediately to confirm his/her email in 15 min and submit a project in 60 min. which make the whole time for this step is 65 min. This will reduce the waiting time for approval and waiting 12 hours for the client to confirm the email.
Steps from 12 to 21: Eliminating and merging:
I think the steps from 12 to 21 can be improved by making the architect attend the meeting between the account manager and client instead of sending the requirements to the architect and waiting for the architect feedback
So, we have to eliminate the steps 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 and merging the steps 12, 16, 20, 21 into one step that could take 400 min
Step 22:
I think we can reduce the waiting in development queue to only 48 hours (2880 min) and also the testing queue to 48 hours
Recalculating the Process Cycle Efficiency
Valued Added time= 65 + 1+30 + 400+30+4320+1440+10 =6296 min
Non valued Added time= 720 + 720 + 4320 +2880+2880 +720 =12240 min
Cycle time= 6296+ 12240 =18536 min
So, Process Cycle Efficiency= 6296/ 18536= 0.163 =33.96%
