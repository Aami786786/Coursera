Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? <b>(2 marks)</b></br>

<b>Email</b></br></br></br>

<b>PROMPT</b></br></br>
Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist. </br>
Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. <b>(3 marks)</b>
</br></br>
You are required to: </br>
1.	Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected. </br>
2.	Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data. </br>
For example, using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?". </br></br>
<b>Describing the problem:</b> Daily we are receiving lots of emails from different sources. It can be work-related emails, it can be from friends or it can be auto-generated emails from machines. That is ok until you receive unwanted emails trying to gain your personal information or trying to deceive you by saying you have won some kind of lottery or whatever. That is a problem everyone is facing.</br></br>
<b>Phrase the problem as a question:</b> The question by ordinary people who don't have knowledge of computer science or IT is that how to differentiate between good emails and bad emails? i.e., spam emails and emails which are not spam.
</br></br></br></br>

<b>PROMPT</b></br>
Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. <b>(5 marks):</b></br>
1.	Analytic Approach </br>
2.	Data Requirements </br>
3.	Data Collection </br>
4.	Data Understanding and Preparation </br>
5.	Modeling and Evaluation </br></br>
You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem. </br></br>
1. Analytic Approach: So the approach is to classify all the emails into two categories a. good emails b. bad emails. Here the decision tree model will be used to identify the yes and no of the spam email. </br>
2. Data Requirement: Required data is such data so that it answers our problem. Here we should have sample spam emails and the emails which are not spam to feed them into the model then to identify the upcoming emails. </br>
3. Data Collection: The existing emails in our inbox is a good source however that may not be enough, so collecting emails from elsewhere like friends can solve this issue. </br>
4. Data Understanding and Preparation: Now that we collected the data (emails) from the inbox and friends' inbox it is time to understand it and prepare it. As we all know that all the emails are unstructured data, we need to use the tools and techniques to convert it into structured data first. It means we are after certain keywords to grab out of these emails. </br>
5. Modeling and Evaluation: We will then build a model/algorithm to check for certain keywords such as money, cash, lottery, whatever keywords which are found in spam emails. For example if an email contains such keywords mark them as the spam. Of course other criteria will also be considered. After the model is built, it will be evaluated and put to the test to see how accurately it is working. We will of course bring changes to the model for better performance by feeding more data into it. Or to change the model itself. </br>
