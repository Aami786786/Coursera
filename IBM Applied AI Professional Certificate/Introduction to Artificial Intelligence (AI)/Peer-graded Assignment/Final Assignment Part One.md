### Q.3) Pick a specific industry or an aspect of our lives or society and describe how YOU think it will be impacted by Artificial Intelligence in future

Travel around with AI. Right time! Right Price!
Competition in the travel and tourism industry is very high. You must have seen that prices keep on fluctuating and change often. You might have also booked a flight ticket in advance or have waited just before the departure date to find cheaper tickets. Everyone does that, but the struggle is minimized with AI. With predictive analytics driven by artificial intelligence, the price can be predicted. The application is able to predict price patterns and alert travelers when to buy the tickets. So, the cheapest rate can be known before you book the flights to your destination.
